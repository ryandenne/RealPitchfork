## Welcome To The Real Pitchfork website

Here everyone can appreciate great tastes in music. 

Unfortunately, we have to show the bad side of music as well.

Glow On recently showed up on our radar. We will regert that day for the rest of our lives.

This band is trying to push some sort of hardcore fusion of a high tempo Chevelle lyrics with shitty Jane's Addiction vocals.
